Check for statements that pertain to effort, rather than accomplishment.

Letters for women are more likely to highlight effort (she is hard-working)
instead of highlighting accomplishments (her research is groundbreaking).

Goal: Develop code that can read text for effort statements. If the text
includes more effort statements, than accomplishment statements; return a
summary that directs the author to add statements related to accomplishment.
